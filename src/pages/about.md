Hi I'm **HÃ©lio Pinheiro,** a self tought 3D artist from Lisbon, Portugal. 

I was born in Africa, moved to Portugal at the age of 3 and was since an early age very fond of arts in general.

When I discovered 3D modelling it started as an hobby but quickly grew up to be a passion and now I'm on the road to make a living out of it.

Countless hours of tutorials got me to where I'm at today but my search for perfection keeps pushing me further and further.

As life is not just about work, I enjoy taking long walks in nature, practice some sports and read a book every now and then, keeping a good balance between body and brain activity.

*Thank You for reading!*
