## *About*

I love the wild west so I decided to create this scene.

It took me a while to get the mood right for what I was aiming for but I'm happy with how it turned out in the end.

The corner of an old saloon, the place nobody wants to go.

Who's the owner of this cowboy hat and this Magnum 44?

Why did he had to leave in such a hurry and didnt even finish his whiskey?
